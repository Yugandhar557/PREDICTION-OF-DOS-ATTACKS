Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned using datasets like NSL KDD, with Machine learning models like KNN, LR and RF which got 98% of accuracy as per author, 
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier with RF + Adaboost and Stacking Classifier  which got 100% accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
